ABOUT

Flippy is an ultra-simple module that generates previous/next pagers for content
types. On the Node type administration screen, you can turn Flippy on or off
for each content type. It'll generate a unique pager for each content type, so
you can page through Articles or page through Blog posts, but you can't page
through all nodes on the site.

To change the position of the pager, visit the content type's Manage Display
page, where fields and other fieldish things can be dragged about. Flippy's
there, too.

If you turn on Flippy for a content type, but hide the pager in the Manage
Display page, its links will still be available in the theme layer when it comes
time to output node.tpl.php. If you like, you can weave the pager links right
into the node manually in your own templates.

HISTORY

Flippy started out as a quick and dirty port of Custom Pagers module to Drupal 7
but quickly spiraled into an over-engineered pile of wacky. It was gutted and
now it's very simple. It might get more features later.

REQUIREMENTS

- Drupal 7
